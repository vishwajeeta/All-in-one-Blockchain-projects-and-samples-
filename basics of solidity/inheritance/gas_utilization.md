Both approaches achieve similar results, but they have slightly different implementations:

1. `string(abi.encodePacked("My Custom Name: ", _name))`: This approach uses `abi.encodePacked` to concatenate the strings. It's a low-level operation that concatenates the strings without allocating memory for the resulting string. This method is efficient in terms of gas costs but might be less readable.

2. `string.concat("Hii i am ",_name)`: This approach uses a library function `concat` which is likely part of a string manipulation library. It's more readable and might be easier to understand for someone reading the code. However, it might introduce additional gas costs compared to the `abi.encodePacked` approach.

Ultimately, the choice depends on your preference for readability versus gas efficiency. If gas efficiency is critical and you're comfortable with the `abi.encodePacked` approach, you can go with the first option. If readability and ease of understanding are more important, you might prefer the second option.

Given that both approaches are valid and achieve similar results, you can choose whichever one aligns better with your priorities and coding style.
